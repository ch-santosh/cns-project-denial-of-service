### **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack Simulation**  
A simple Streamlit-based project to simulate a **Denial of Service (DoS) attack** by flooding a server with multiple requests and analyzing its impact on response time and CPU usage.  

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project demonstrates a **basic DoS attack** using Python and Streamlit by:  
✅ Sending multiple HTTP requests to a test server.  
✅ Measuring the impact on **response time** and **CPU usage**.  
✅ Visualizing results with an **interactive line chart**.  

⚠ **Disclaimer:** This project is for **educational purposes only**. Do not use it to attack real systems.

## 🚀 **Installation & Setup**  
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dos-simulation.git
cd dos-simulation
```
### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**  
```bash
pip install streamlit requests psutil
```
### **3️⃣ Run the Streamlit App**  
```bash
streamlit run dos_simulation.py
```
Now, open the displayed URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8501/`) in your browser.  

---

## 📊 **How It Works**  
1️⃣ Select the **number of requests** using the slider.  
2️⃣ Click **"Simulate Attack"** to start flooding the target server.  
3️⃣ The app measures **CPU usage before & after** the attack.  
4️⃣ A **graph** displays how response time increases under heavy load.

## 🛡 **How It Demonstrates DoS in CNS**  
✔ **Simulates flooding a server with excessive traffic**.  
✔ **Overloads system resources**, leading to **delayed responses**.  
✔ **Analyzes impact on performance using CPU and response time metrics**.  

💡 **Future Enhancements:**  
- Use a **local Flask server** to demonstrate real-time server overload.  
- Simulate **Distributed DoS (DDoS)** by running **parallel requests**.  

---

## 📝 **Example Output**  
- **CPU Usage Before & After Attack**  
- **Response Time Graph (Higher spikes = More delays)**
